"""
Given the root of a binary search tree and the lowest and highest boundaries as low and high, trim the tree so that all its elements lies in [low, high]. Trimming the tree should not change the relative structure of the elements that will remain in the tree (i.e., any node's descendant should remain a descendant). It can be proven that there is a unique answer.

Return the root of the trimmed binary search tree. Note that the root may change depending on the given bounds.

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree in the range [1, 104].
0 <= Node.val <= 104
The value of each node in the tree is unique.
root is guaranteed to be a valid binary search tree.
0 <= low <= high <= 104
