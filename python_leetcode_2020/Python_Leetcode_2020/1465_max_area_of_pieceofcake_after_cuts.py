"""
Given a rectangular cake with height h and width w, and two arrays of integers horizontalCuts and verticalCuts where horizontalCuts[i] is the distance from the top of the rectangular cake to the ith horizontal cut and similarly, verticalCuts[j] is the distance from the left of the rectangular cake to the jth vertical cut.

Return the maximum area of a piece of cake after you cut at each horizontal and vertical position provided in the arrays horizontalCuts and verticalCuts. Since the answer can be a huge number, return this modulo 10^9 + 7.

Constraints:

2 <= h, w <= 10^9
1 <= horizontalCuts.length < min(h, 10^5)
1 <= verticalCuts.length < min(w, 10^5)
1 <= horizontalCuts[i] < h
1 <= verticalCuts[i] < w
It is guaranteed that all elements in horizontalCuts are distinct.
It is guaranteed that all elements in verticalCuts are distinct.
