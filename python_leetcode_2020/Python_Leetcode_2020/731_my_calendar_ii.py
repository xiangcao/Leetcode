1. brute force
Maintain a list of bookings and a list of double bookings. When booking a new event [start, end), if it conflicts with a double booking, it will have a triple booking and be invalid. Otherwise, parts that overlap the calendar will be a double booking.
class MyCalendarTwo:
    def __init__(self):
        self.calendar = []
        self.overlaps = []

    def book(self, start, end):
        for i, j in self.overlaps:
            if start < j and end > i:
                return False
        for i, j in self.calendar:
            if start < j and end > i:
                self.overlaps.append((max(start, i), min(end, j)))
        self.calendar.append((start, end))
        return True
2. sweeping
When booking a new event [start, end), count delta[start]++ and delta[end]--. When processing the values of delta in sorted order of their keys, the running sum active is the number of events open at that time. If the sum is 3 or more, that time is (at least) triple booked.

A Python implementation was not included for this approach because there is no analog to TreeMap available.


class MyCalendarTwo {
    TreeMap<Integer, Integer> delta;

    public MyCalendarTwo() {
        delta = new TreeMap();
    }

    public boolean book(int start, int end) {
        delta.put(start, delta.getOrDefault(start, 0) + 1);
        delta.put(end, delta.getOrDefault(end, 0) - 1);

        int active = 0;
        for (int d: delta.values()) {
            active += d;
            if (active >= 3) {
                delta.put(start, delta.get(start) - 1);
                delta.put(end, delta.get(end) + 1);
                if (delta.get(start) == 0)
                    delta.remove(start);
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
