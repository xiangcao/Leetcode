Question:
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target.

Return the number of non-empty subsequences of nums such that the sum of the minimum and maximum element on it is less or equal than target.

Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

Solution:
Intuition
Almost same as problem two sum.
If we want to know the count of subarray in sorted array A,
then it's exactly the same.
Make sure you can do two sum before continue.


Explanation
Sort input A first,
For each A[i], find out the maximum A[j]
that A[i] + A[j] <= target.

For each elements in the subarray A[i+1] ~ A[j],
we can pick or not pick,
so there are 2 ^ (j - i) subsequences in total.
So we can update res = (res + 2 ^ (j - i)) % mod.

We don't care the original elements order,
we only want to know the count of sub sequence.
So we can sort the original A, and the result won't change.


Complexity
Time O(NlogN)
Space O(1) for python
(O(N) space for java and c++ can be save anyway)

class Solution:
    def numSubseq(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        nums.sort()
        l, r = 0, len(nums) - 1
        res = 0
        mod = 10**9 + 7

        while l <= r:
            if nums[l] + nums[r] > target:
                r -= 1
            else:
                res += pow(2, r - l, mod)
                l += 1

        return res % mod
