"""
There are n servers numbered from 0 to n-1 connected by undirected server-to-server connections forming a network where connections[i] = [a, b] represents a connection between servers a and b. Any server can reach any other server directly or indirectly through the network.

A critical connection is a connection that, if removed, will make some server unable to reach some other server.

Return all critical connections in the network in any order.

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 10^5
n-1 <= connections.length <= 10^5
connections[i][0] != connections[i][1]
There are no repeated connections.

    First thought
Thiking for a little while, you will easily find out this theorem on a connected graph:

An edge is a critical connection, if and only if it is not in a cycle.
So, if we know how to find cycles, and discard all edges in the cycles, then the remaining connections are a complete collection of critical connections

    (For coding purpose, if a node is not visited yet, it has a special rank -2; if we've fully completed the visit of a node, it has a special rank n.)
